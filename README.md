# My Voron V0.2 Configuration & Slicer Profiles

## Printer Details
- [Voron V0.2](https://vorondesign.com/voron0.2) based build
- CAN-Toolhead based on EBB36

## Slicer Details
- I'm using [SuperSlicer](https://github.com/supermerill/SuperSlicer)
- Profiles are optimised for quality first and speed 2nd. They are still pretty fast though
- I'm printing primarily PETG or PLA, profiles likely need tweaking for ABS
